          Over nine years, our Leverhulme Doctoral Programme will train 40 PhD
          researchers, bringing together expertise in AI, neuroscience,
          neurotechnology, psychology, engineering, philosophy, and law. Through
          this interdisciplinary approach, we will establish the scientific

        <p className="lead">Three of the first cohort's 11 opportunities are Masters+ places. The remaining eight are PhD scholarships.</p>
        <p>
          Masters+ combines a Master's stage with a route towards doctoral
          research. It offers a preparatory stage before a PhD in a programme
          that spans human intelligence, intelligent systems, and responsible
          innovation.
        </p>
        <h3>The Master's stage</h3>
        <p>
          The Master's stage provides a foundation for the proposed doctoral
          research. The specific degree, taught modules, research component,
          duration, and host university will be published with each approved
          opportunity. These may differ between opportunities.
        </p>
        <h3>Progression to a PhD</h3>
        <p>
          Progression requirements and the relationship between the Master's
          and PhD stages will be set out in the final offer and application
          guidance. Progression should not be assumed to be automatic.
        </p>
        <h3>Eligibility and funding</h3>
        <p>
          Entry qualifications, selection criteria, tuition-fee coverage,
          maintenance support, and home and international eligibility are
          awaiting confirmation. Check the individual opportunity's approved
          terms before applying.
