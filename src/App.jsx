          Responsible Hybrid Intelligence (RHI) brings together the University of
          Strathclyde and the University of Glasgow to explore how people and
          intelligent systems can learn and adapt together, safely and responsibly.
        </p>
        <p>
          As AI and neurotechnology advance, the relationship between people and
          intelligent systems is changing. Our aim is to understand how this

          agency, and accountability.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over nine years, our Leverhulme Doctoral Programme will train 40 PhD
          researchers, bringing together expertise in AI, neuroscience,
          neurotechnology, psychology, engineering, philosophy, and law. Through
          this interdisciplinary approach, we will establish the scientific
          foundations of Responsible Hybrid Intelligence and prepare the next
          generation of researchers to shape its future.
        </p>
        <p>
          The programme builds on the complementary strengths of the Strathclyde
          Neurotechnology Centre and Glasgow Neurotechnology Centre, with an equal
          partnership between the two universities. Students, academics, and
          collaborators will work together across disciplines to address the
          scientific and societal questions at the heart of human–AI collaboration.
        </p>
        <p>
          This work is supported by a £5 million award from The Leverhulme Trust
          and a further £4.1 million investment from the University of Strathclyde
          and the University of Glasgow. Their shared commitment enables ambitious,
          curiosity-driven research into a responsible future for hybrid intelligence.
